## About  
**Rust-Items** is an open-source repository that categorizes and documents items and prefabs in the game **Rust**. It provides an easy reference for developers, server owners, and modders looking for item details, prefab names, and structured item groups.  

## Categories  
The repository organizes items into different categories for easy navigation:  

- **Weapons** – Guns, bows, melee weapons, and ammunition.  
- **Attire** – Clothing, armor, and wearable accessories.

- **Tools** – Pickaxes, hammers, and all utility tools.  
- **Resources** – Gatherable resources such as wood, sulfur, and metal.  
- **Fun** – Fireworks, instruments, and other fun items.  
- **Food & Medical** – Consumables, medicine, and healing items.  
- **Traps** – Turrets, landmines, and all types of traps.  
- **Prefabs** – Essential for modding, containing Rust’s prefabs list.  

Each category is stored in markdown (`.md`) files for easy reading and contribution.
